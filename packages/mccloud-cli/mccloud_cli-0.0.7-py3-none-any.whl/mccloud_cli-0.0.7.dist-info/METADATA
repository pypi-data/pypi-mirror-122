# Intro

`mccloud_cli` is a command line interface to the McCloud service. McCloud provides
a simple means to run a [Shasta](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta) genome assembly
in the cloud. `mccloud_cli` can generate presigned URLs for use with the
McCloud web UI, and submit McCloud jobs directly from the command line.

To use `mccloud_cli`, you must have the [AWS command line](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) set up and working
correctly with your AWS account. Please refer to the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) for more information on this prerequisite.

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and working correctly with your account.
   A good test is the ability to successfully move data in and out of your own
   S3 bucket (e.g., `aws --profile your-aws-profile-name s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name/`)
2. [optional] We highly reccommend that you run all python programs in a
   [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Set up
   and activate a virtual environment.
3. `pip install mccloud-cli`
4. `mccloud_cli --help`

# Presigned URLs example

`mccloud_cli` can generate AWS presigned URLs. This is useful when you want to store your
data in _your own_ AWS S3 bucket (i.e., privately), but temporarily grant McCloud
access to read input data, and write results back to your bucket.

IMPORTANT: AWS S3 presigned URLs are a standard way to share data, but make the assumption
that you won't share the URL with anyone. For more information on presigned URLs, please read the
[AWS S3 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html).

Usage:

```
$ mccloud_cli generate-s3-presigned-url --help
Usage: mccloud_cli generate-s3-presigned-url [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --profile TEXT             Use a specific profile from your AWS credential file.
  --no-confirmation BOOLEAN  Perform requested actions without user confirmation.
  -i, --input-url TEXT       S3 URL which will be presigned to allow READ (input) access.
  --expires-in INTEGER       Number of seconds until the pre-signed URLs expire.  [default: 172800]
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
```

For example:

```
$ mccloud_cli generate-s3-presigned-url --profile my-aws-profile -i s3://my-bucket/reads.fasta.gz -o s3://my-bucket/results.tar.gz

This action will generate AWS S3 presigned URLs for the input and output URLs you have specified, with an expiration time 172800 seconds [2 days] from now.

Read (input) URLs:
------------------
s3://my-bucket/reads.fasta.gz

Do you wish to proceed? [y/N]: y

Your presigned URLs will expire in 24 hours.

Please launch the McCloud job with these URLs.

Presigned INPUT URLs:
---------------------
https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/reads.fasta.gz?AWSAccessKeyId=...
```

# Job submission example

`mccloud_cli` will also submit jobs directly from the command line. Input and output URLs must
be `https` URLs or `s3` URLs in a bucket you have access to.

Usage:

```
$ mccloud_cli submit-job --help
Usage: mccloud_cli submit-job [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --mcat TEXT                     McCloud Access Token, ie, MCAT-****.  [required]
  --email EMAIL ADDRESS           Email address for job notifications.  [required]
  -i, --input-url TEXT            S3 URL which will be presigned to allow READ (input) access.  [required]
  -o, --output-url TEXT           A single S3 URL which McCloud has write access to.  [required]
  --shasta-version TEXT           [required]
  --shasta-config TEXT            [required]
  --shasta-cli-opts TEXT
  --I-have-read-and-agree-to-McCloud-terms-of-use
                                  Confirm that you have read, and agree to, the McCloud terms of use, available at
                                  https://mccloud.czi.technology/terms-of-use
  --tail-job-log                  After job is submitted, print out job log messages.
  --profile TEXT                  Use a specific profile from your AWS credential file.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

For example:

```
$ mccloud_cli submit-job --mcat 'MCAT-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX' --email my@email.com --profile my-aws-profile -i s3://my-bucket/reads.fasta.gz -o s3://my-bucket/output-folder --shasta-version 0.7.0 --shasta-config Nanopore-Sep2020
I have read and agree to mccloud terms of use [y/N]: Y
