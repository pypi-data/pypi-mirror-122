Description: # What's CAC
        
        This repository contains a library of Content-Aware Computing (CAC) by Fujitsu.<br>
        CAC is a software technology that aims at easy, high-speed, lightweight, and accurate deep learning processing.
        
        # Contents
        
        ## 1. Gradient-Skip
        
        Gradient-Skip is an approach for CNNs to skip backward calculations for layers that enouch converged.<br>
        This reduces calculations in backward and communications of gradient.<br>
        You can use Gradient-Skip by simply replacing the optimizer with our SGD.<br>

        ## 2. Automatic Pruner
        
        Automatic Pruner is a pruning tool for neural networks, which can determine the pruning rate of each layer automatically.<br>

        ## 3. Synchronous-Relaxation
        Relaxed Synchronization technique removes slow processes from the group of distributed training and prevent limiting overall training speed due to slow processes. <br>

        # Quick Start
        
        ### Linux
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/FujitsuLaboratories/CAC.git
        cd CAC
        python setup.py install
        ```
        CAC will be registered in PyPI at a later date and will be able to pip install
        ```
        pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir ./
        ```
