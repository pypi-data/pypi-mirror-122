Description: # materialdashboard
        
        `materialdashboard` is a Dash component library exposing [Material-UI](https://next.material-ui.com/) components.
        
        Dash components are automatically generated using TypeScript definitions from the source React components.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install materialdashboard
        ```
        
        Although it is not listed in the requirements for this package, you will obviously need [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to include the components in a web app.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Although the component properties should be documented from the extracted TypeScript comments, please refer to the [Material-UI documentation](https://mui.com/components/) for more information about each component.
        
        ## Examples
        
        Examples can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/flovouin/materialdashboard/tree/master/examples):
        
        -   [Layout](https://github.com/flovouin/materialdashboard/blob/master/examples/layout.py) (mostly the `Grid` component)
        -   [Input components](https://github.com/flovouin/materialdashboard/blob/master/examples/inputs) (buttons, selects, switches, text fields, etc.)
        
        # Limitations
        
        ### Child nodes
        
        Child nodes are only supported for the `children` property of each component. If Material-UI components expect child components for properties other than `children`, you will not be able to pass a Dash component to them. You can however pass other types. For example, a string is a valid child node.
        
        ### Events
        
        Not all events are implemented. Currently, all components support clicks through the `n_clicks` property. If you need an event that's currently missing, please open an issue or a pull request.
