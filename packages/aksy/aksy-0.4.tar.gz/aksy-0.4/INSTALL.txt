0. PREAMBLE

This document is part of the Aksy source distribution. More information and
installation instructions for binary distributions can be found at
http://walco.n--tree.net/projects/aksy/wiki 

1. DEPENDENCIES

Aksy (core lib) has the following dependencies:

* Python: version >= 2.4

* libusb: libusb.sourceforge.net
  (win32 port is available at libusb-win32.sourceforge.net)

The extension has been tested with Python 2.4/2.5, libusb 0.1.8, libusb-0.1.10
and libusb-0.1.12 on Windows and Ubuntu Linux. Note: on Windows (XP) the
specific libusb version 0.1.12.1 didn't find the sampler on my system. Later
(snapshot) versions are ok.

optional dependencies
---------------------

Ak.py (by Joseph Misra) needs a recent GTK and its python bindings.
These are all available in modern Linux distributions, for Windows it's a bit
more manual installation work.

  * GTK+ runtime 2.10.11 from http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/
  * PyGTK (PyCairo/PyGObject/PyGTK) from www.pygtk.org
  * libglade 2.4.0 (available at http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/)

AksyFS:
  * fuse-python, version 0.2pre3 or higher (available at http://fuse.sf.net)
