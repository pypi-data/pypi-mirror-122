# Regressions Library

The regressions library is a collection of Python algorithms for fitting data to different functional models by using linear algebra and machine learning. It can generate the following eight key regression models based on any data set: linear, quadratic, cubic, hyperbolic, exponential, logarithmic, logistic, and sinusoidal. For each model, it outputs the constants of the equation, notable graphical points, and the correlation coefficient, among other useful details. It is publicly available for download on the Python Package Index (PyPI), and its complete documentation is hosted on Read the Docs. To learn more about downloading the library, view its [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/regressions/). To learn more about how to use it, view its [documentation](https://regressions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Code Examples

**Linear Regression Model**
```python
def linear_model(data, precision = 4):
    independent_variable = single_dimension(data, 1)
    dependent_variable = single_dimension(data, 2)
    independent_matrix = []
    dependent_matrix = column_conversion(dependent_variable)
    for element in independent_variable:
        independent_matrix.append([element, 1])
    solution = system_solution(independent_matrix, dependent_matrix, precision)
    coefficients = no_zeroes(solution, precision)
    equation = linear_equation(*coefficients, precision)
    derivative = linear_derivatives(*coefficients, precision)['first']['evaluation']
    integral = linear_integral(*coefficients, precision)['evaluation']
    points = key_coordinates('linear', coefficients, precision)
    five_numbers = five_number_summary(independent_variable, precision)
    min_value = five_numbers['minimum']
    max_value = five_numbers['maximum']
    q1 = five_numbers['q1']
    q3 = five_numbers['q3']
    accumulated_range = accumulated_area('linear', coefficients, min_value, max_value, precision)
    accumulated_iqr = accumulated_area('linear', coefficients, q1, q3, precision)
    averages_range = average_values('linear', coefficients, min_value, max_value, precision)
    averages_iqr = average_values('linear', coefficients, q1, q3, precision)
    predicted = []
    for element in independent_variable:
        predicted.append(equation(element))
    accuracy = correlation_coefficient(dependent_variable, predicted, precision)
    evaluations = {
        'equation': equation,
        'derivative': derivative,
        'integral': integral
    }
    points = {
        'roots': points['roots'],
        'maxima': points['maxima'],
        'minima': points['minima'],
        'inflections': points['inflections']
    }
    accumulations = {
        'range': accumulated_range,
        'iqr': accumulated_iqr
    }
    averages = {
        'range': averages_range,
        'iqr': averages_iqr
    }
    result = {
        'constants': coefficients,
        'evaluations': evaluations,
        'points': points,
        'accumulations': accumulations,
        'averages': averages,
        'correlation': accuracy
    }
    return result
```

**Correlation Coefficient**
```python
def correlation_coefficient(actuals, expecteds, precision = 4):
    residuals = multiple_residuals(actuals, expecteds)
    deviations = multiple_deviations(actuals)
    squared_residuals = []
    for residual in residuals:
        squared_residuals.append(residual**2)
    squared_deviations = []
    for deviation in deviations:
        squared_deviations.append(deviation**2)
    residual_sum = sum_value(squared_residuals)
    deviation_sum = sum_value(squared_deviations)
    if deviation_sum == 0:
        deviation_sum = 10**(-precision)
    ratio = residual_sum / deviation_sum
    if ratio > 1:
        return 0.0
    else:
        result = (1 - ratio)**(1/2)
        return rounded_value(result, precision)
```
