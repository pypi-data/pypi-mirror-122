## About The Project

Now many games in the market need to log in every day and do similar operations repeatedly, which is very time-consuming and boring. 
Therefore, I want to create a program that can automatically play games instead of us.
I need a general auto game library to achieve my goal.
The library should have these features:
* Firstly, I need an API of games simulators, which can capture the game outputs through images (sounds may be captured in the future), and enter inputs into the game similar to mouse and keyboard, etc.; 
* Secondly, it should integrate most image algorithms to identify key information quickly and accurately in the game scene; 
* Moreover, a GUI interface is also necessary for users, and so on.
There are many automatic game playing frameworks available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs, so I created this.
Maybe this library can also meet your needs.


## Getting Started

To use this library just running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is a library written in Python, so you need to ensure that [Python](https://www.python.org) exists.

### Installation


```shell
pip install autogame-python
```

### Usage

```python
import autogame
```
