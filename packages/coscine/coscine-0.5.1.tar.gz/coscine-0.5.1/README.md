# Coscine Python Client

![Coscine](data/logo.png)

[Coscine](https://coscine.rwth-aachen.de/) is an integration platform for
research data hosted at RWTH Aachen University. For more information visit
the [Landing Page](https://coscine.de/).

## About

This python3.x library provides a simple interface to Coscine. You can use it
to integrate Coscine in your python applications and easily:
- create or delete projects and resources
- invite and manage project members
- upload and download files, resources or even whole projects
- manage your metadata

Even if you plan on using the API directly in a programming language of your choice,
you might want to take a look at this module as it provides you with a handy
debug mode which logs all requests and responses made in the communication with coscine.
This makes it simple to understand how certain workflows should be implemented or why
something in your implementation might not work.
