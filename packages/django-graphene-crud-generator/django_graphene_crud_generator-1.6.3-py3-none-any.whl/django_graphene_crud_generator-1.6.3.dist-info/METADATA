Introduction
============

This package allows you to generate CRUD operation in a compact way.
It is extensible but has sane default (at leastfor my project :] ).

This library is **not** a django application, although it works with it.

Installation

.. code-block::

   pip install django-graphene-crud-generator

Usage
=====

TLDR

   dff

Guide
-----

The project is basically a factory that generates graphene types repersenting queries and mutations.
Each step of the generation process is extensible.
