# GitAPI: An API made for GitHub Stats!
> Coded in [Python3](https://python.org), uploaded to [PyPi](https://pypi.org), and coded by [JBYT27](https://github.com/JBYT27)

## About
### About
GitAPI is an API made with python - styled with json - to make the data preferably easier to use. It is made up of posting `json` requests, and retrieving that data from a function, and transfering that data into an output, in which you can use.

This API is designed to show GitHub stats for certain users, or viewing GitHub itself, in data form.

> To learn how to use it, you can read the Usage header below.

### Languages used
Languages used to program this package were: [Python3](https://python.org)

### Queries
Not all of the GitHub queries are in here, but if you wish to see all of them, go to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/queries) GitHub docs.

## Usage
### Installation

To install and use the package, you must first:

```shell
pip install git_api
```

This will install the package - `git_api`(GitAPI) - and then you will be able to use it. 

To then import it, you must put the following code:

```py
import git_api
```
**OR**
```py
import git_api as gitapi
```
**OR**
```py
from git_api import *
```
For more information, go [here](https://pypi.org/project/git-api/).

> Note that all of these methods work.

### Usage
To use this package, first import it as shown above. Then create a python file - name it whatever you want, it doesn't matter.

Once you're done with that, open the file, and add the following example code:

```py
import git_api

Token() # We'll place the personal access token here later on. For now, it'll be empty.
user_info = User("Username here").User() # Insert your username in the argument shown here.

print(user_info)
```

You've done it! But wait - it doesn't work, it only gives an error! The reason for this is that - 

**NUMBER 1**: You need a personal access token which we'll discuss in a moment.

**NUMBER 2**: You need to have a GitHub username in mind and place it in the assigned space.

Let's start with number 1, creating the token.

#### 1: The Token
To first create a token, you must create or use an existing GitHub account. If you already have a GitHub account, you can move on to the next section. However, if you are *creating* a new GitHub account, follow the instructions below:

#1: Go to [`https://github.com`](https://github.com) and click `sign up`.

#2: Once you've clicked that, just follow the instructions shown on the page.

#3: Then after that, you can either get used to GitHub and do this later, or do this immediately; Go to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) document and read it thoroughly, as it holds the information to creating a personal token. Choose the categories you think will best fit for your project and finish up with the token.

#4: Note that this token should be kept private and not shared. If you are positive that this token will be private, then you can just copy and paste the token into a string (inside parentheses), and insert it into the token argument space. However, if you know that this will be shown to the public, create a `.env` file, and paste the token inside there. Make sure you make it a variable, for example, like this:

```
token=blahblahblah
```
Also note that you can only copy the token once, so check that you actually copied down the token. Go back into your python file and copy/paste down the following code into the assigned space;

```py
os.environ["token"] # Insert your .env variable here
```
#5: Then you're pretty much done! Your final code example should look something like this:

#### 2: Finale

```py
import git_api

Token(os.environ["token"])
user_info = User("JBYT27").User()

print(user_info)
```

> This will print some of the user's information.
