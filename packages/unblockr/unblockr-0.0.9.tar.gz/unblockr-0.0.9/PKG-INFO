# About Unblockr
Unblockr is a python package used to create alternate browsers easily and without much coding knowledge. This can be used to bypass blocking extensions on school chromebooks. This package uses [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) and [webbot](https://pypi.org/project/webbot/).

# How To
Before you begin, I highly recommend making an account on [replit.com](https://replit.com). In my opinion, it is the best site to use with Unblockr. Make an account [here](https://replit.com/signup).

Create a repl in [replit.com](https://replit.com) by clicking the blue `+` button in the top right corner of the main page or by clicking on the menu and selecting **+ Create repl**. You will then be given several options. Select `python` for your repl __template__ and name your repl anything you want. Leave the privacy section as is. Then, click the **+ Create Repl** button and your new repl will open!

To install unblockr, use the pip command `pip install unblockr` in the shell tab. Next, type `from unblockr import firefox` in your `main.py` file.  If you would like to use chrome instead, replace 'firefox' with 'chrome'. `main.py` should be the only file in your repl. Then run the file by click in the **Run** button or typing `CTRL + Enter`, your console should respond with a firefox window. Be sure to wait at least five seconds for the browser to load.

# Errors
When you receive an error (the text in the console appears in red and the browser doesn't load), try these things before reporting the error:
* Make sure your first line looks like this: `from unblockr import firefox` or this: `from unblockr import chrome`.
* Open the 'shell' tab on the right and type `pip install unblockr`. Then press enter.
* Rerun the repl by pressing the **Run** button at the top or typing `CTRL + Enter`.
* Reload the page.
* Make sure the file is named `main.py`.
