        ## Content
        
        OpenAP library has two parts, which are __OpenAP model data__ and __OpenAP Python packages__.
        
        
        ### Model data
        
        Data in this repository includes:
        
          - Aircraft data: Collected from open literature.
          - Engines data: Primarily from ICAO emission data-bank, including fuel flow and emissions.
          - Drag polar data: Exclusively derived from open data ([reference](https://junzis.com/files/openap_dragpolar.pdf)).
          - Kinematic data: Kinematic model (formally [WRAP](https://github.com/junzis/wrap)) describe speed, altitude, and vertical rate.
          - Navigation data: Airport and waypoints obtained from [X-plane ](https://developer.x-plane.com/docs/data-development-documentation/).
        
        
        ### Python packages
        
        The OpenAP Python library includes the following packages:
        
          - `prop`: a package for accessing aircraft and engine properties
          - `thrust`: a package for computing aircraft thrust
          - `drag`: a package for computing aircraft drag
          - `fuel`: a package for computing fuel consumption
          - `emission`: a package for computing aircraft emissions
          - `kinematic`: a package for accessing WRAP data
          - `aero`: a package for common aeronautical conversions
          - `nav`: a package for accessing navigation information
          - `segment`: a package for determining climb, cruise, descent, level flight
          - `phase`: a wrapper around `segment`, providing identification of all flight phases
          - `traj`: package contains a set of tools for trajectory generation
