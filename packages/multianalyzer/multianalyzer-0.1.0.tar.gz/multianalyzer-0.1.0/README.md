# Multianalyzer
Rebinning of powder diffraction data taken with multiple analyzer crystals and a large area detector

This project is about the rebinning of data comming from the [high resolution powder diffraction beamline (ID22) at the ESRF](https://www.esrf.fr/id22). 
It implements the math which are described in [J. Appl. Cryst. (2021). 54, 1088-1099](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576721005288).

## installation
