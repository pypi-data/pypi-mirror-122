# MyPwd

Very simple password manager for my python projects.

I often forgot the passwords in my scripts and committed them to the repository. So I created a simple password manager so that it doesn't happen to me anymore.

## Usage

Create file `mypwd.json` with passwords in your home directory. For example `C:\Users\jarberan\mypwd.json`

```json
{
  "postgres": {
    "login": "john",
    "password": "myPa$$w0rd"
  },
  "mongo": {
    "login": "john",
    "password": "mongopass",
    "note": "Valid until end of month"
  }
}
```

Now you can access your passwords from python code and you will never commit password anymore.

```python
import mypwd

login = mypwd.get_login("mongo")
password = mypwd.get_pwd("mongo")
note = mypwd.get_value("mongo", "note")

uri = f"mongodb://{login}:{password}@myserver.com/admin?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

### Keep your passwords safe and encrypt mypwd.json with GPG

You should store your passwords in encrypted file `mypwd.json.gpg` instead of in plain text file `mypwd.json`.

1. install GPG (if you are using GitBash you probably have gpg already installed)
1. create key-pair `gpg --gen-key`
1. encrypt your passwords `gpg --output mypwd.json.gpg --encrypt --recipient your@email.com mypwd.json`
1. try to decrypt it `gpg --decrypt mypwd.json.gpg`
1. finally you can remove plain text file `rm mypwd.json` and mypwd will use `mypwd.json.gpg`


## Installation

Installation is simple:

```
pip install mypwd
```

or

```
python setup.py install
```
