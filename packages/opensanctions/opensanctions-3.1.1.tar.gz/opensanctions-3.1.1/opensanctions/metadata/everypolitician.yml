prefix: evpo
summary: >
  All members of national parliament in the world, collected from hundreds of
  government web sites and consolidated via Wikidata.
description: |
  The EveryPolitician project ran until 2019 and created a mechanism for consolidating 
  data about members of parliament for 233 different countries and territories. As part
  of the project, EveryPolitician operated a large fleet of crawlers which would update
  politician profiles in [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org), the structured data version
  of Wikipedia.

  The project was [shut down in June 2019](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/), 
  leaving the contained data to slowly wither in precision. We are including
  EveryPolitician in OpenSanctions as a stopgap measure until we can devise a better
  plan for gathering [PEPs data](https://opensanctions.org/datasets/peps/) or ally with
  other initiatives that do the same.

  The OpenSanctions importer only includes individuals active within the past 15 years.
