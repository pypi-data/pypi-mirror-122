Antichecked Exceptions
======================

Antichecked Exceptions are an alternative to checked exceptions. They're
designed to actively catch bugs, and to prevent silencing exceptions for
the sake of satisfying the compiler (as usually happens with checked
exceptions).

Rather than requiring the caller to catch some exceptions, Antichecked
Exceptions intercepts some raised exceptions, and helps guarantee to the
caller, if the caller opts to catch some exception, that the exception
was actually raised by a deliberate design decision rather than a typo
or bug.
