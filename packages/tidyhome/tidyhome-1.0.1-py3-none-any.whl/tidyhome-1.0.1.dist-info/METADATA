# tidyhome: a package for accessing CFPB U.S. home mortgage data

## What is tidyhome?

Tidyhome is a package that simplifies the process of retrieving Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) [HMDA Platform API](https://cfpb.github.io/hmda-platform/#hmda-api-documentation).

The 'HMDA Platform API' refers to several APIs designed to handle various tasks. Of these APIs, tidyhome interacts with the 'Data Browser' API.

The goal of tidyhome is to allow users the option to circumnavigate making API requests in their web browser. The freedom to do so may prove useful to data scientists who are tasked with analyzing HMDA data.

## Installation

Install tidyhome using:

```python
pip install tidyhome
```

## How to use tidyhome

Tidyhome contains several classes and functions that are designed to simplify and guide the process of making a valid API request.

Tidyhome's classes are designed to be passed as arguments to the :races: and :actions: parameters of tidyhome's functions.

Tidyhome's functions use the arguments passed in function call parameters as the arguments passed in the API request it makes.

Below is a brief overview of each class/function and an example of how tidyhome can be used.

### Classes:

* ```Race```: an enumerated class containing races recorded as part of a home mortgage application or loan. You can use these to get data for only the races you specify.

* ```Action```: an enumerated class containing actions taken by lending institutions on the filed application or loan. You can use these to get data for only the actions you specify.

### Functions:

* ```get_aggregations```: returns a pandas DataFrame containing aggregate data of all loans reported.

* ```get_loans```: returns a pandas DataFrame containing all lending institutions that reported HMDA data.

* ```get_institutions```: returns a pandas DataFrame containing raw HMDA data on all individual loans reported.

### Usage example:

```python
>>> tidyhome.get_loans(2019, "dc", [tidyhome.Action.INCOMPLETE, tidyhome.Action.PREAPPROVED], [tidyhome.Race.BLACK, tidyhome.Race.WHITE])
```

The above function call returns a DataFrame containing HMDA data on all individual loans in 2019 in DC where the file was closed for incompleteness or the loan was preapproved, and the reported races of applicants/borrowers were black or white.
