# General Instructions

## Generating API token

This project uses [openrouteservice API](https://openrouteservice.org) to plot maps and routes.
So the following steps are necessary at first:

1. Sign up on [openrouteservice.org](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup) to generate an API token;
2. Create a `.env` file with the following content: `TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`, where `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` is the token generated in the step before;

## Accident road data

The accidents data used were extracted from the Polícia Rodoviária Federal website.
The notebook `get_data.ipynb` inside `safety_road_mapping/notebooks` folder is responsible to download and extract the data used. If you want to directly download the files you can [click here](https://www.gov.br/prf/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/dados-abertos-acidentes).

## Roadmap

- The accidents data used comes just from federal police source, so there are some routes that don't receive score because they are state highways.
- The routes subsections are not connected, once they are plotted individually in the map. Visually it can be interesting to connect them. (Is it possible or necessary?)
