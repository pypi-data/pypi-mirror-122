    """ This function compares and calculates the error between model prediction
    and data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    real_data : pd.DataFrame with 2 columns
                theta: float. Angle in radians.
                obs_relative_pressure: float>0. Observed relative pressure in comparison to on-axis.

                  theta: float. Angle in radians.
                  pred_relative_pressure: float>0. Predicted relative pressure in comparison to on-axis.

    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------
    error_function : function that calculates the mis/match between data and predictions.
                     Defaults to the sum of absolute error observed.

    Returns
    --------
    prediction_error : output format depends on the exact error function used.

def dbeam_by_dtheta_error(real_data, predictions):
    '''
    Calculates the first order derivative of the beamshape with reference to
    the angle of emission.

    If the overall error in dbeam/dtheta is low it means that the real data and
    predictions match well in their shape, but not so much in their exact values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    real_data
