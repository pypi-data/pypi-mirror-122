## Source code

Gemican's source code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/khoulihan/gemican). If you feel like hacking, take a look at [Pelican's internals](gemini://gemini.hyperlinkyourheart.com/gemicandocs/pages/gemican-internals.gmi).


## Why the name "Gemican"?

"Gemican" is an anagram of *camegin*, which means nothing.

Only joking - Gemican is based on the Pelican static site generator, and took its name from that.
