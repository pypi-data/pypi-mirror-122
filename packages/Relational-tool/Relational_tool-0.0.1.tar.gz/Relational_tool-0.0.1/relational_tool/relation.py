    '''
    This object defines a relation (as a group of consistent tuples) and operations.

    A relation is a particular kind of set, which has a number of named attributes and
    a number of tuples, which must express a value for every attribute.

    Set operations like union, intersection and difference are restricted and can only be
    performed on relations which share the same set of named attributes.

    The constructor optionally accepts a filename and then it will load the relation from
    that file.

    If no parameter is supplied an empty relation is created.

    Files need to be comma separated as described in RFC4180.

    The first line need to contain the attributes of the relation while the
    following lines contain the tuples of the relation.

    An empty relation needs a header, and can be filled using the insert()
    method.
