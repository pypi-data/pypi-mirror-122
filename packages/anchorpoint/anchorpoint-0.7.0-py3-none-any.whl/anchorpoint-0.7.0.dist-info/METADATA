Anchorpoint supplies TextQuoteSelector and TextPositionSelector
classes based on the Web Annotation Data Model, which is
a `W3C Recommendation`_. Anchorpoint includes helper methods
for switching between selector types, and
a `pydantic`_ schema for serialization. Anchorpoint is used
by `Legislice`_ for referencing laws such as statutes, and
by `AuthoritySpoke`_ for referencing judicial opinions.

`API Documentation`_ is available on readthedocs.

Anchorpoint relies on `python-ranges`_ to perform set operations on spans of text.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Javascript, try the `Text Quote Anchor`_ and `Text Position Anchor`_ packages.

In Python try python-ranges_, which is the basis for much of the TextPositionSelector class's behavior.
