Description: # Wagtail Localize RWS LanguageCloud
        
        This allows users of [RWS LanguageCloud](https://www.rws.com/translation/language-cloud/) to translate and localize Wagtail CMS content.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - python >= 3.7
        - django >= 2.2
        - wagtail >= 2.11
        - wagtail-localize >= 1.0rc2
        
        ## Setup
        
        1. `pip install TODO...`
        2. Add to `INSTALLED_APPS` in Django settings:
        
            ```python
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'wagtail_localize_rws_languagecloud',
            ]
            ```
        
        3. Configure the plugin in Django settings:
        
            ```python
            import datetime
        
            WAGTAILLOCALIZE_RWS_LANGUAGECLOUD = {
                # (required) Authentication details to connect to the LanguageCloud API.
                # For info on how to obtain these credentials see https://languagecloud.sdl.com/lc/api-docs/authenticate
                'CLIENT_ID': '<client id>',
                'CLIENT_SECRET': '<client secret>',
                'ACCOUNT_ID': '<account id>',
        
                # (required) Identifier of a LanguageCloud template to create projects from
                'TEMPLATE_ID': '<template id>',
        
                # (required) Identifier of a LanguageCloud location to store project files in
                'LOCATION_ID': '<location id>',
        
                # (optional) Prefix for project names. Defaults to '' if not specified
                'PROJECT_PREFIX': 'foobar_',
        
                # (optional) A timedelta object used to set the project 'due by' date.
                # Defaults to datetime.timedelta(days=7) if not specified
                'DUE_BY_DELTA': datetime.timedelta(days=30),
            }
            ```
        
        
        ## Synchronisation
        
        This plugin uses a background job to:
        
        - Identify text in wagtail which is pending localization and export it to LanguageCloud
        - Identify completed projects in LanguageCloud and import the localized content back into Wagtail
        
        This is done using a management command `./manage.py sync_rws`.
        
        This can be run on a regular basis using a scheduler like cron. We recommend an interval of about every 10 minutes. It is desirable to prevent more than one copy of the sync command from running at the same time.
        
        - If using cron as a scheduler, [lockrun](http://unixwiz.net/tools/lockrun.html) can be used to prevent multiple instance of the same job running simultaneously.
        - If using a queue-based scheduler like Celery Beat, the `SyncManager` class contains `is_queued` and `is_running` extension points which could be used to implement a lock strategy.
        
        ## How it works
        
        This plugin uses `wagtail-localize` to convert pages into segments and build new pages from translated segments. `wagtail-localize` provides a web interface for translating these segments in Wagtail itself and this plugin plays nicely with that (translations can be made from the Wagtail side too).
        
        Pages/snippets are submitted to LanguageCloud when they are submitted for translation from the default locale. Pages authored in other locales are not supported yet.
