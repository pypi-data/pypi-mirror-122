A collection of utility python functions for handling LAMMPS output and polymers in Python.

This toolbox provides means to read LAMMPS output: be it data, dump or thermodynamic data files. 
Additionally, it provides various methods to calculate with the read data, such as computing the 
radius of gyration, mean end to end distance, or simply splitting a polymer network back up into its chains.

## Installation

Use pip:

`pip install pylimer-tools`
