    description: >
      The ensemble data product, SeaFlux (Fay et al. (2021),
      doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4133802, https://github.com/luke-gregor/pySeaFlux),
      accounts for the diversity of the underlying mapping methodologies.
      Utilizing six global observation-based mapping products, the SeaFlux ensemble
      approach adjusts for methodological inconsistencies in flux calculations
      that can result in an average error of 15 % in global mean flux estimates.
      We address differences in spatial coverage of the surface ocean CO2
      between the mapping products. Fluxes are calculated using three
      wind products (CCMPv2, ERA5, and JRA55).
