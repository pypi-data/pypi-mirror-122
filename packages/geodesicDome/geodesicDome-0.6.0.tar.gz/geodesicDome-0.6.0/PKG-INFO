====================

About
-------
The purpose of this library is to assist in storing the vertices in a geodesic dome,
and contain methods to allow neighbourhood searches and tessellation of the vertices
to be performed efficiently.

The library provides:
* Tessellation for a geodesic dome surface
* Provide index based storage and neighbouring search algorithm
* Provide functionality for uneven surface tessellation

Installation
-------
To install our library run this command in your terminal:
pip install geodesicDome
