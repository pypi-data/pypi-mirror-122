Description: # atomic-operator
        
        This python package is used to execute Atomic Red Team tests (Atomics) across multiple operating system environments.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Support local execution of Atomic Red Teams tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems
        * Can prompt for input arguments but not required
        * Assist with downloading the atomic-red-team repository
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install **atomic-operator** on OS X, Linux, or Windows. You can also install it directly from the source. To install, see the commands under the relevant operating system heading, below.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        The following libraries are required and installed by atomic-operator:
        
        ```
        pyyaml==5.4.1
        fire==0.3.1
        requests==2.26.0
        attrs==21.2.0
        ```
        
        ### macOS, Linux and Windows:
        
        ```bash
        pip install atomic-operator
        ```
        
        ### Installing from source
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/swimlane/atomic-operator.git
        cd atomic-operator
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage example (command line)
        
        You can run `atomic-operator` from the command line or within your own Python scripts. To use `atomic-operator` at the command line simply enter the following in your terminal:
        
        ```bash
        atomic-operator --help
        ```
        
        ### Retrieving Atomic Tests
        
        In order to use `atomic-operator` you must have one or more [atomic-red-team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) tests (Atomics) on your local system. `atomic-operator` provides you with the ability to download the Atomic Red Team repository. You can do so by running the following at the command line:
        
        ```bash
        atomic-operator get_atomics 
        # You can specify the destination directory by using the --destination flag
        atomic-operator get_atomics --destination "/tmp/some_directory"
        ```
        
        ### Running Tests
        
        In order to run a test you must provide some additional properties (and options if desired). The main method to run tests is named `run`.
        
        ```bash
        # This will run ALL tests compatiable with your local operating system
        atomic-operator run --atomics-path "~/atomic-red-team-master"
        ```
        
        ### Additional parameters
        
        You can see additional parameters by running the following command:
        
        ```bash
        atomic-operator run -- --help
        ```
        
        You should see a similar output to the following:
        
        ```text
        NAME
            atomic-operator run - The main method in which we run Atomic Red Team tests.
        
        SYNOPSIS
            atomic-operator run <flags>
        
        DESCRIPTION

        FLAGS
            --technique=TECHNIQUE
                One or more defined techniques by attack_technique ID. Defaults to 'All'.
            --atomics_path=ATOMICS_PATH
                The path of Atomic tests. Defaults to os.getcwd().
            --check_dependencies=CHECK_DEPENDENCIES
                Whether or not to check for dependencies. Defaults to False.
            --get_prereqs=GET_PREREQS
                Whether or not you want to retrieve prerequisites. Defaults to False.

        ## Usage example (scripts)
        
        To use **atomic-operator** you must instantiate an **AtomicOperator** object.
        
        ```python
        from atomic_operator import AtomicOperator
        
        operator = AtomicOperator()
        
        # this will run tests on your local system
        operator.run(
            technique: str='All', 
            atomics_path=os.getcwd(), 
            check_dependencies=False, 
            get_prereqs=False, 
            cleanup=False, 
            command_timeout=20, 
            show_details=False,
            prompt_for_input_args=False,
            **kwargs
