# cz-git-jira-conventional

**cz-git-jira-conventional** is a plugin for the [**commitizen tools**](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen), a toolset that helps you to create [**conventional commit messages**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Since the structure of conventional commits messages is standardized they are machine readable and allow commitizen to automaticially calculate and tag [**semantic version numbers**](https://semver.org/) as well as create **CHANGELOG.md** files for your releases.

This plugin extends the commitizen tools by:
- **require a Jira issue id** in the commit message
- **create links to Git** commits in the CHANGELOG.md
- **create links to Jira** issues in the CHANGELOG.md

When you call commitizen `commit` you will be required you to enter the scope of your commit as a Jira issue id (or multiple issue ids, prefixed or without prefix, see config below).
```

## Installation

Install with pip
`python -m pip install cz-git-jira-conventional` 

You need to use a cz config file that has the **required** additional values `jira_base_url` and `git_repo` and may contain the **optional** value `jira_prefix` if you are only using one Jira project (then the prefix for this project will be added automatically).

Example `.cz.yaml` config for this repository
```yaml
commitizen:
  name: cz_git_jira_conventional
  tag_format: v$version
  version: 1.0.0
  jira_base_url: https://myproject.atlassian.net
  git_repo: https://yourgit.com/username/project
```

### pre-commit
Add this plugin to the dependencies of your commit message linting with `pre-commit`. 

Example `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen
    rev: v2.17.13
    hooks:
      - id: commitizen
        stages: [commit-msg]
        additional_dependencies: [cz-git-jira-conventional]
```
Install the hook with 
```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```
