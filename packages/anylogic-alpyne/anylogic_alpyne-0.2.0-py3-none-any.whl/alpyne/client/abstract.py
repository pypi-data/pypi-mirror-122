    A base class for running multiple sims. It handles much of the routine logic (e.g., checking states), allowing for
    higher brevity user code.

    To use, create a subclass - e.g., `class MyMultiRun(BaseMultiRun):` - and implement the two abstract methods.

    You may also wish to override the optional methods, `on_episode_step` and `on_episode_finish`, if you wish to
    add callback logic.

    Tip: Override `on_episode_finish` if you wish to query the outputs of a sim before it gets reset.

    An abstract Gym environment. It's purpose is to simplify using Alpyne with RL libraries expecting Gym environments
    (e.g., stable-baselines).

    This base class comes with the routine/common code needed to take steps and reset the sim already implemented.
    To utilize it, you need to implement the code which is model-specific. Namely:

    - Describing the observation space and the action space (a requirement for custom Gym environments).
    - Converting your `Observation` objects (taken from the underlying model) to the type described by your observation
    space.
    - Converting the action passed from the RL library to an `Action` object (that your underlying model can process).
    - Calculating the numerical reward based on the observation taken in the next step after an action.

    Additionally, there is a non-required method that you can override to serve as an additional terminal condition
    (on top of the ones setup by your model).
