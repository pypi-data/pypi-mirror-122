Bubbletea
--

A python library which enables developers and data scientists to quickly build any data applications on top of The Graph network. Whether you are building dashboards to visualize protocol data or leveraging existing machine learning models to do some data science work, we hope this library will be the fastest way to get what you want.

This project is made possible by a grant (wave 2) from The Graph foundation. 

### What problems are we solving
- An improved way to query data from The Graph network
- A set of handy functions for common data transformations (built on Pandas)
- A set of out-of-box charting components to make visualizations effortless (built on Altair)
- A simple templating system to build dashboards (built on Streamlit)
