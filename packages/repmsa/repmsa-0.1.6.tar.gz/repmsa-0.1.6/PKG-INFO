## What is repmsa?

Creating a percentage identity matrix from a multiple sequence alignment and then ranking them to select the best sequence representetive
in the Multiple Sequence Alignment. repmsa ranks the sequences based on highest identity.

## Installation

`pip install repmsa`

## Usage
```python
from repmsa import RankMatrix
var = RankMatrix(msa_file)
print(var.dm) #prints the distance matrix
df #prints the distance matrix in data frame.
var.id_iter #is the iterator from highest ranked to lowest rank.
var.ranked #returns the ranked list in a listed tuple.
var.topids() # returns the id of the highest ranked sequence, each time its called it moves the next highest one.
var.seq_by_id('QIQ56215.1') # returns the sequence by the id that is provided.
```
