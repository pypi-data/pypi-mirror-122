Bagua is a distributed training utility developed by [AI platform@Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/en) and [DS3 Lab@ETH](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/). Users can extend the training on a single GPU to multi-GPUs (may across multiple machines) by simply adding a few lines of code. One prominent feature of Bagua is to provide a flexible system abstraction that supports state-of-the-art system relaxation techniques of distributed training. Powered by the new system design, Bagua has a great ability to implement and extend various state-of-the-art distributed learning algorithms. This in turns enables better scalability and efficiency of the end-to-end training process.
Researchers can also easily develop new distributed training algorithms within the Bagua framework, without worrying about low-level optimizations.

So far, Bagua has integrated communication primitives including

- Centralized Synchronous Communication (AllReduce)
- Decentralized Synchronous Communication
- Low Precision Communication

Its effectiveness has been evaluated in various scenarios, including VGG and ResNet on ImageNet, BERT Large and many industrial applications at Kuaishou.

## Installation & Quick Start

Develop version:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/BaguaSys/bagua.git
```

Release version:

```
pip install bagua
```

See [Bagua tutorials](https://bagua-tutorials.kwai-seattle.com/getting-started/) for quick start guide.

## Quick Start on AWS

Thanks to the [Amazon Machine Images (AMI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html), we can provide users an easy way to deploy and run Bagua on AWS EC2 clusters with flexible size of machines and a wide range of GPU types. Users can find our pre-installed Bagua image on EC2 by a unique AMI-ID that we publish here. 

| Bagua version  | AMI ID |  Region |
|---|---|---|
| 0.6.3 | ami-0e719d0e3e42b397e | us-east-1 |

To manage the EC2 cluster more efficiently, we use [Starcluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/) as a toolkit to manipulate the cluster. In the `config` file of Starcluster, there are a few configurations that need to be set up by users, including AWS credentials, cluster settings, etc. More information regarding the Starcluster configuration can be found in this [tutorial](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/quickstart.html). Note that AMI is a regional resource, so you need to specify the AMI ID and its corresponding EC2 region at the same time.

For example, we create a EC2 cluster with 4 machines (`p3.16xlarge`), each of which has 8 V100 GPUs. The cluster is based on the Bagua AMI we pre-installed in `us-east-1` region. Then the `config` file of Starcluster would be:

```yaml
# region of EC2 instances, here we choose us_east_1
AWS_REGION_NAME = us-east-1
AWS_REGION_HOST = ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
# AMI ID of Bagua
NODE_IMAGE_ID = ami-0e719d0e3e42b397e
# number of instances
CLUSTER_SIZE = 4
# instance type
NODE_INSTANCE_TYPE = p3.16xlarge
```

With above setup, we created two identical clusters to benchmark a synthesized image classification task over Bagua and Horovod, respectively. Here is the screen recording video of this experiment.

## Limitations

* When communication is not a bottleneck in the training task, using Bagua communication algorithms will not provide significant performance improvement (unless you use other optimizations in Bagua such as fused optimizer).
* Currently only tested on Linux and NVIDIA GPUs.
