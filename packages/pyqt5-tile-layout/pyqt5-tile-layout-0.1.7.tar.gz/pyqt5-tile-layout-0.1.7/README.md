A tile layout for PyQt where you can put any widget in a tile. The user is then able to drag and drop the tiles and resize them

![](https://github.com/arnaudframmery/qt-tile-layout/blob/main/showoff.gif?raw=true)

# Quick example

Just launch the ```test.py``` script to have a first look (be sure to have installed PyQt5 from the `requirements.txt` file).
You can have an overview of how to use the different methods in this script.  

Moreover, you can change the value of ```static_layout``` variable to ```False``` to experiment a tile layout where the tile sizes are dynamics with the parent widget size (like a classic layout)

If you are interested about drag and drop widgets between several QTileLayouts, check the ```testLink.py``` script.

# Create and use a tile layout

First, you have to install the PyPi package:

```shell script
pip install pyqt5-tile-layout
```

And import the QTileLayout:

```python
from QTileLayout import QTileLayout
```

Then, let's create a tile layout with 8 rows and 5 columns.  
We also give the vertical and horizontal spawn in pixel:

```python
layout = QTileLayout(
    rowNumber=8,
    columnNumber=5,
    verticalSpawn=100,
    horizontalSpan=150,
    verticalSpacing=5,
    horizontalSpacing=5,
)
```

We can now add a widget in a specific position: it's the same as the grid layout:

```python
layout.addWidget(
    widget=QtWidgets.QLabel('Hello world'),
    fromRow=3,
    fromColumn=2,
    rowSpan=1,
    columnSpan=2,
)
```

Finally, if you put your layout into a window, you will be able to drag and drop the above widget and resize its

_Allows or not the drag and drop of tiles in the layout_  
&nbsp;
  
- ```acceptResizing(bool value)```

_Allows or not the resizing of tiles in the layout_  
&nbsp;
