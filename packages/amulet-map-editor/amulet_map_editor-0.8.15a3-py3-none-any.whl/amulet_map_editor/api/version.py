VERSION_REGEX Documentation

    This is not a documentation of regular expression syntax, just documentation on the subsequences that this regular expression looks for
    For an in-depth guide on regular expressions, see here: https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/python
    
    Our version scheme allows for an optional "v" prefix, so that subsequence is tested by "v?"
    
    Since we use the Semantic Versioning scheme, our version numbers follow this format: <major>.<minor>.<patch>
    with the <patch> number being optional (only if it's value would be 0 for that version)
    That is tested by "(?P<major>\d+)\.(?P<minor>\d+)(\.(?P<patch>\d+))?"
    
    - For the major and minor numbers, "(?P<major>\d+)" will match any non-zero number of digits and group them under the
        "major" group (in this instance)
    - "\." will then match the separating "." character
    - Since the patch number is optional, "(\.(?P<patch>\d+))?" is used instead, the second "." is included in the 
        optional group, but other wise the capturing group is the same as the major/minor numbers
        
    We then use an optional release type flag to denote whether the release is a beta or alpha release and it's number:
    "((a(?P<alpha>\d+))|(b(?P<beta>\d+)))?"
    
    For our nightly builds, we also denote a unique build number with the prefix of ".dev": "(\.dev(?P<devnum>\d{12}))?"
    
    Finally, our version scheme also denotes when Amulet is being ran from source, while this information isn't
    necessarily used for update checking, we use it to determine if the update dialog should be shown. If a commit 
    hash/count is found in the version string of the current Amulet instance, the dialog is not shown. Our regular 
    expression uses the following to detect that subsequence: 
        "(\+(?P<commit_count>\d+)\.g(?P<commit_hash>[a-z\d]+)(\.dirty)?)?"
        
    - "commit_count" group signifies the number of commits since the last release
    - "commit_hash" group is the current commit hash
    - ".dirty" denotes whether uncommitted changes have been made
