Description: # Gb_probability_dist package
        
        Gb_probability_dist is a Python package that provides Gaussian and Binomial distribution implementations. With these classes you can instantiate an object in a distribution and then plot it or load data from a file. You can also add one with another distribution of the same type to get a third one.
        
        # Installation
        ------------
        ## Dependencies
        
        gb_probability_dist requires:

        ## User installation
        You can install it easily with pip.
        
        ```
        pip install gb_probability_dist
        ```
        
        # Create your first probability distributions
        
        ```shell
        $ python
        ```
        
        ```python
        >>> from gb_probability_dist import Gaussian, Binomial
        >>> Gaussian(10, 7)
        mean 10, standard deviation 7
        >>> Binomial(.4, 25)
        mean 10.0, standard deviation 2.4494897422783178, n 25
        >>> new_gaussian = Gaussian(25,2) + Gaussian(50,5)
        >> new_gaussian
        mean 75, standard deviation 5.385164807134504
