    The physical process can have streams attached to it, and a mass balance
    can be performed on these streams.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    processname : `str`
        The name assigned to a physical process as its identifier.  
 
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    streamregistry : `dict` {`str`: `pychemengg.physicalmassbalance.PhysicalProcess.Stream`}
        The streamregistry is a dictionary that stores
        all streams attached to a physical process.
        The keys of the dictionary are names of streams and the 
        values are the "Stream" object itself.
        
 
    Examples
    --------
    First import the module **physicalmassbalance**
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        >>> from pychemengg.massbalances import physicalmassbalance as pmb 
        >>> mixer1 = pmb.PhysicalProcess("mixer1")

        Parameters
        -----------
        streamnames : `list` [`str`, `str`, ...]
            A list containing streamnames.
        
        flowrates : `list` [`str` or `int` or `float`, `str` or `int` or `float`, ...]. optional
            A list containing flowrates for each stream. 
            
            - Use positive `int` or `float` for inlet stream.
            - Use negative `int` or `float` for outlet stream.
            
            If flowrate is unknown, use:
            
            - "F" or "+F" for inlet stream, and
            - "-F" for outlet stream
        
        fractions : `list` [ [`str` or `int` or `float`, `str` or `int` or `float`, ...], [`str` or `int` or `float`, `str` or `int` or `float`, ...], ...]. optional
            A list containing a list of component fractions for each stream.
            If the component fraction is unknown use the string "x".
        
        extrainfos : `list` [ [`str`], [`str`], ...], optional
            A list containing extrainfo for a stream represented as a string.
            
            Example:
            
            **CASE 1: Relation between component flowrates in different streams is provided.**
            
            
                Let extrainfo : ["2:S1=1.2*S4"] 
                
                This means that for component '2', the 'component flowrate' in S1
                is 1.2 times that in S4.
            
            
            **CASE 2: Relation between overall stream flowrates is provided.**
            
                Let extrainfo : ["S1=1.2*S4"]
                
                This means overall flowrate of stream S1 is 1.2 times the
                overall flowrate of stream S4.

        
        Returns
        --------
        Single `~.Stream` instance OR `list` of `~.Stream` instances
            If a single stream with just name is created, a single
            '~.Stream' instance is returned.
            If more than one stream is created, a list of `~.Stream` instances
            is returned.

        ------
        - The Stream class requires three arguments:
            
            i) self : instance of Stream object (passed automatically by Python))
    
            ii) instance of physical process
    
            iii) streamname
    
            By calling the Stream as *PhysicalProcess.Stream(self, streamname)*,
            the arguments ii) and iii) are being provided. The 'self' in this
            statement is the physical process to which the stream is attached,
            which is argument ii) and streamname satisfies argument iii).
        
        
        - Attributes

            There are three `~.Stream` attributes set by this method.
            
            - flowrate : `int` or `float` or `str`
                Stream flowrate.
            - fractions : a list containing [`int` or `float` or `str`, `int` or `float` or `str`, ... ]
                Component mass/mole fractions of a stream.
            - extrainfo : a list of [`str`]
                Extra information between component or total flowrates between streams.

        -------
        parsed_extrainfo : as list of lists
                            [[], [],[]]
            Each sub list contains the following list elements 
          
            CASE 1: COMPONENT flowrate relationship
            [componentindex, left_streamsign, left_streamname, ratio, right_streamname]

            example:
                let extrainfo : ["2:S1=1.2*S4"] 
                This means for component '2', the component flowrate in S1 is 1.2 times that in S4
                So component '2' flowrates in S1 and S4 will be
                    in S1 = F * x (F = total flowrate of S1, and x = component '2' fraction in S1)
                    in S4 = F * x (F = total flowrate of S4, and x = component '2' fraction in S4)
                And equation becomes : abs(F*x for S1) - abs(F*x for S4) = 0
                This equation is NOT formulated by this method/function.
                This method/function ONLY parses the information input by user
                in a manner it can be used later to formulate this equation
                
                So the extrainfo can be parsed as follows:
                componentindex = '2'   
                left_streamsign = +1 if 'S1' is input
                                 -1 if 'S1' is output
                left_streamname = 'S1'
                ratio = '1.2'
                right_streamname = 'S4'
                
                NOTE: "left_streamsign" is NOT needed to formulate the desired
                equation for 'COMPONENT flowrate' relationship. But it is required for
                'OVERALL flowrate' relationship between streams. Therefore to maintain
                uniformity in signature of 'return value', we keep this field

            CASE 2: OVERALL flowrate relationship
            [componentindex, left_streamsign, left_streamname, ratio, right_streamname]
            example:
                let extrainfo : ["S1=1.2*S4"] 
                then:
                componentindex = FALSE
                left_streamsign = +1 if 'S1' is input
                                 -1 if 'S1' is output
                left_streamname = 'S1'
                ratio = 1.2
                right_streamname = 'S4'
                
                Out put of this method is then used to create the equation
                
                left_streamflow - left_streamsign * abs(eval(ratio) * right_streamflow)
                
                The reasoning is that the righthandside should evaluate
                to flowrate of S1, and the sign should be +1 or -1 based on convention
                chosen of input or output streams respectively

        For example consider three streams:
        
        ==================   ============   =================
        Stream               Flowrate       Fractions
        ==================   ============   =================
        Inlet 1              F1             [x11, x12, x13]
        Inlet 2              F2             [x21, x22, x23]
        Outlet 3             F3             [x31, x32, x33]
        ==================   ============   =================

        The nparray for flowrates is:
            
            A = 
            
            [[F1]
             
            [F2]
             
            [F3]] 
             
            shape = (3, 1)
        
        
        The nparray for component fractions is:
            
            B =
            
            [[x11, x12, x13]
            
            [x21, x22, x23]
            
            [x31, x32, x33]] 
            
            shape = (3, 3)
        
        
        :math:`x_{m,n}` : 
            
            - m : stream index
            - n : component index
        
        To perform component mass balance, the row of matrix 'A' is multiplied
        to row of matrix 'B' 
        
        C = 
        
        [[F1*x11, F1*x12, F1*x13]
        
        [F2*x21, F2*x22, F2*x23]
        
        [F3*x31, F3*x32, F3*x33]]
        
        Each column of 'C' represents flowrate of a component.
        By summing the column of 'C' the component mass balance can be
        performed. 
        
        - Sum of column 1 = Flowrate balance for component 1
        - Sum of column 2 = Flowrate balance for component 2
