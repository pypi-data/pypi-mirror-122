    4. Logic:
        
        Explicit formula for computing 'effectiveness' for each of the above
        exchanger types is implemented in a separate method. 
        When that method is called, it internally calls another
        method ("_get_eff_or_ntu"). This method checks which of
        "effectiveness" or "NTU" is missing. If "effectiveness" is
        missing, and "NTU" is provided, the explict equation is used
        to compute effectiveness from "NTU". If "NTU" is missing, the same
        explict equation for effectiveness becomes an implicit equation for "NTU",
        and it is solved using 'fsolve' of scipy to find "NTU". A
        seperate explict equation for calculating "NTU" from "effectiveness"
        is not implemented. The advantage of this approach is that for the
        case of "Single pass counter flow with both fluid unmixed", there
        is no explict relationship for "NTU" reported in textbooks, but
        there is one for computing "effectiveness". So in this manner by using
        'fsolve', the "NTU"" for the case of "Single pass counter flow
        with both fluid unmixed" can also be computed.

    First import the module **heatexchangers**.
       
    >>> from pychemengg.heattransfer import heatexchangers as hx 
    >>> hx1 = hx.EffNTU(Cmin=0.639, Cmax=0.836, NTU=0.854)
    # This will create an instance of EffNTU and assign it to "hx1".
    # Methods of the class 'EffNTU' can then be called.
    # In this particular example, NTU is assigned = 0.854.
    # By default effectiveness = "?".
    # When a heat exchanger type is next called, it will automatically
    # compute the effectiveness for that exchanger type
    # For example
    >>> hx1.shelltube(shellpass_count=1, tubepass_count=8)
    0.4621565341983249
    # This is the effectiveness.

        -----
        1. Function - 'func' is passed to this method.
        2. A check is made whether "effectiveness" or "NTU" is unknown.
        3. If "effectiveness" is unknown, the function object, "func"
        is used to compute "effectiveness" from known "NTU" because
        func is explicit for "effectiveness" in the form :
            effectiveness = func(NTU).
        4. If "NTU" is unknown, the same function object, "func" is
        used to solve for "NTU" with known effectiveness by setting
        the equation: func(x) - effectiveness = 0.
