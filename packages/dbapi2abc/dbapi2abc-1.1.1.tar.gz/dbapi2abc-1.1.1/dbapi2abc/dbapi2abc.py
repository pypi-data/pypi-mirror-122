    These objects represent a database cursor, which is used to manage the
    context of a fetch operation. Cursors created from the same connection
    are not isolated, i.e., any changes done to the database by a cursor are
    immediately visible by the other cursors. Cursors created from different
    connections can or can not be isolated, depending on how the transaction
    support is implemented (see :meth:`Connection.rollback` and
    :meth:`Connection.commit`).

        NOTE: SQLite returns the number of rows the update where clause
        matches, not the number affected.

        The attribute is -1 in case no :meth:`Cursor.execute` has been

        variables in the operation. Variables are specified in a
        database-specific notation (see the module's paramstyle attribute for
        details)

        A reference to the operation will be retained by the cursor. If the
        same operation object is passed in again, then the cursor can optimize
        its behavior. This is most effective for algorithms where the same
        operation is used, but different parameters are bound to it (many
        times).

        For maximum efficiency when reusing an operation, it is best to use the
        .setinputsizes() method to specify the parameter types and sizes ahead
        of time. It is legal for a parameter to not match the predefined
        information; the implementation should compensate, possibly with a loss
        of efficiency.

        The parameters may also be specified as list of tuples to e.g. insert
        multiple rows in a single operation, but this kind of usage is
        deprecated:
        :meth:`~dbapi.Cursor.executemany`

        .execute() method or by using array operations to have the database
        process the sequence as a whole in one call.

        Use of this method for an operation which produces one or more result
        sets constitutes undefined behavior, and the implementation is

        that a result set has been created by an invocation of the operation.

        no more rows are available.

        The number of rows to fetch per call is specified by the parameter. If
        it is not given, the cursor's arraysize determines the number of rows
        to be fetched. The method should try to fetch as many rows as indicated
        by the size parameter. If this is not possible due to the specified
        number of rows not being available, fewer rows may be returned.

        Note there are performance considerations involved with the size
        parameter. For optimal performance, it is usually best to use the
        .arraysize attribute. If the size parameter is used, then it is best
        for it to retain the same value from one .fetchmany() call to the next.

        operation.
