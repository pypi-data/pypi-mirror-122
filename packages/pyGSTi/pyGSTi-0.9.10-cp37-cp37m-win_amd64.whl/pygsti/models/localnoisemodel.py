class LocalNoiseModel(_ImplicitOpModel):
    """
    A n-qubit implicit model that allows for only local noise.

    This model holds as building blocks individual noisy gates
    which are trivially embedded into circuit layers as requested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_qubits : int
        The total number of qubits.

    gatedict : dict
        A dictionary (an `OrderedDict` if you care about insertion order) that
        associates with gate names (e.g. `"Gx"`) :class:`LinearOperator`,
        `numpy.ndarray` objects. When the objects may act on fewer than the total
        number of qubits (determined by their dimension/shape) then they are
        repeatedly embedded into `num_qubits`-qubit gates as specified by `availability`.
        While the keys of this dictionary are usually string-type gate *names*,
        labels that include target qubits, e.g. `("Gx",0)`, may be used to
        override the default behavior of embedding a reference or a copy of
        the gate associated with the same label minus the target qubits
        (e.g. `"Gx"`).  Furthermore, :class:`OpFactory` objects may be used
        in place of `LinearOperator` objects to allow the evaluation of labels
        with arguments.

    prep_layers : None or operator or dict or list
        The state preparateion operations as n-qubit layer operations.  If
        `None`, then no state preparations will be present in the created model.
        If a dict, then the keys are labels and the values are layer operators.
        If a list, then the elements are layer operators and the labels will be
        assigned as "rhoX" where X is an integer starting at 0.  If a single
        layer operation of type :class:`State` is given, then this is used as
        the sole prep and is assigned the label "rho0".

    povm_layers : None or operator or dict or list
        The state preparateion operations as n-qubit layer operations.  If
        `None`, then no POVMS will be present in the created model.  If a dict,
        then the keys are labels and the values are layer operators.  If a list,
        then the elements are layer operators and the labels will be assigned as
        "MX" where X is an integer starting at 0.  If a single layer operation
        of type :class:`POVM` is given, then this is used as the sole POVM and
        is assigned the label "Mdefault".

    availability : dict, optional
        A dictionary whose keys are the same gate names as in
        `gatedict` and whose values are lists of qubit-label-tuples.  Each
        qubit-label-tuple must have length equal to the number of qubits
        the corresponding gate acts upon, and causes that gate to be
        embedded to act on the specified qubits.  For example,
        `{ 'Gx': [(0,),(1,),(2,)], 'Gcnot': [(0,1),(1,2)] }` would cause
        the `1-qubit `'Gx'`-gate to be embedded three times, acting on qubits
        0, 1, and 2, and the 2-qubit `'Gcnot'`-gate to be embedded twice,
        acting on qubits 0 & 1 and 1 & 2.  Instead of a list of tuples,
        values of `availability` may take the special values:

        - `"all-permutations"` and `"all-combinations"` equate to all possible
        permutations and combinations of the appropriate number of qubit labels
        (deterined by the gate's dimension).
        - `"all-edges"` equates to all the vertices, for 1Q gates, and all the
        edges, for 2Q gates of the geometry.
        - `"arbitrary"` or `"*"` means that the corresponding gate can be placed
        on any target qubits via an :class:`EmbeddingOpFactory` (uses less
        memory but slower than `"all-permutations"`.

        If a gate name (a key of `gatedict`) is not present in `availability`,
        the default is `"all-edges"`.

    qubit_labels : tuple, optional
        The circuit-line labels for each of the qubits, which can be integers
        and/or strings.  Must be of length `num_qubits`.  If None, then the
        integers from 0 to `num_qubits-1` are used.

    geometry : {"line","ring","grid","torus"} or QubitGraph
        The type of connectivity among the qubits, specifying a
        graph used to define neighbor relationships.  Alternatively,
        a :class:`QubitGraph` object with node labels equal to
        `qubit_labels` may be passed directly.

    evotype : Evotype or str, optional
        The evolution type of this model, describing how states are
        represented.  The special value `"default"` is equivalent
        to specifying the value of `pygsti.evotypes.Evotype.default_evotype`.

    simulator : ForwardSimulator or {"auto", "matrix", "map"}
        The circuit simulator used to compute any
        requested probabilities, e.g. from :method:`probs` or
        :method:`bulk_probs`.  The default value of `"auto"` automatically
        selects the simulation type, and is usually what you want. Other
        special allowed values are:

        - "matrix" : op_matrix-op_matrix products are computed and
          cached to get composite gates which can then quickly simulate
          a circuit for any preparation and outcome.  High memory demand;
          best for a small number of (1 or 2) qubits.
        - "map" : op_matrix-state_vector products are repeatedly computed
          to simulate circuits.  Slower for a small number of qubits, but
          faster and more memory efficient for higher numbers of qubits (3+).

    on_construction_error : {'raise','warn',ignore'}
        What to do when the conversion from a value in `gatedict` to a
        :class:`LinearOperator` of the type given by `parameterization` fails.
        Usually you'll want to `"raise"` the error.  In some cases,
        for example when converting as many gates as you can into
        `parameterization="clifford"` gates, `"warn"` or even `"ignore"`
        may be useful.

    independent_gates : bool, optional
        Whether gates are allowed independent local noise or not.  If False,
        then all gates with the same name (e.g. "Gx") will have the *same*
        (local) noise (e.g. an overrotation by 1 degree), and the
        `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a single key per gate
        name.  If True, then gates with the same name acting on different
        qubits may have different local noise, and so the
        `operation_bks['gates']` dictionary contains a key for each gate
         available gate placement.

    ensure_composed_gates : bool, optional
        If True then the elements of the `operation_bks['gates']` will always
        be :class:`ComposedOp` objects.  The purpose of this is to
        facilitate modifying the gate operations after the model is created.
        If False, then the appropriately parameterized gate objects (often
        dense gates) are used directly.

    global_idle : LinearOperator, optional
        A global idle operation, which is performed once at the beginning
        of every circuit layer.  If `None`, no such operation is performed.
        If a 1-qubit operator is given and `num_qubits > 1` the global idle
        is the parallel application of this operator on each qubit line.
        Otherwise the given operator must act on all `num_qubits` qubits.
