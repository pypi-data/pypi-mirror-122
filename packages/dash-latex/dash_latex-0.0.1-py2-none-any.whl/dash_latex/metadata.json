Differences between the two modes include:\nDisplay mode starts in \\\\displaystyle, so \\\\int and \\\\sum are large, for example; while inline mode starts in \\\\textstyle, where subscripts and superscripts usually don't stack on top of operators like \\\\sum. You can always manually switch between \\\\displaystyle and \\\\textstyle using those commands.\nDisplay mode centers math on its on line and disables automatic line breaking (though you can customize this behavior with custom CSS). In inline mode, KaTeX allows line breaks after outermost relations (like = or <) or binary operators (like + or \\\\times), the same as TeX."
