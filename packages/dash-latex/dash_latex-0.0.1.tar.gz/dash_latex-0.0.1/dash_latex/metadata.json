You can always manually switch between \\\\displaystyle and \\\\textstyle using those commands.\nDisplay mode centers math on its on line and disables automatic line breaking (though you can customize this behavior with custom CSS). In inline mode, KaTeX allows line breaks after outermost relations (like = or <) or binary operators (like + or \\\\times), the same as TeX."
