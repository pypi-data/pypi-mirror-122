Code for running metrics that quantify locality (e.g. county, community of interest) splitting in districting plans, including:
- Geography-based
	- Number of localities split
	- Number of locality-district intersections
- Population-based
	- Effective splits
	- Conditional entropy
	- Square root entropy
	- Split pairs

Options are provided to ignore zero-population regions and to calculate symmetric splitting scores.
