hydroMT_ is a python package, developed by Deltares, to build and analysis hydro models.
It provides a generic model api with attributes to access the model schematization,
(dynamic) forcing data, results and states. This plugin provides an implementation 
for the DELWAQ_ model.

Installation
------------

hydroMT-delwaq is availble from pypi and we are working on adding a release from conda-forge (ongoing).

To install hydromt_delwaq using pip do:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install hydromt_delwaq

We recommend installing a hydromt-delwaq environment including the hydromt_delwaq package
based on the environment.yml file. This environment will install all package dependencies 
including the core of hydroMT_ as well as the `hydromt_wflow <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt_wflow>`_ plugin.

.. code-block:: console

  conda env create -f environment.yml
