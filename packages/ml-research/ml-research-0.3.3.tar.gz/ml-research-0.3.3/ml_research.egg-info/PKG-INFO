ML-Research
===========

This repository contains the code developed for all the publications I
was involved in. The LaTeX and Python code for generating the paper,
experiments' results and visualizations reported in each paper is
available (whenever possible) in the paper's directory.

Additionally, contributions at the algorithm level are available in the
package ``research``.

Installation and Setup
----------------------

A Python distribution of version 3.7 or higher is required to run this
project.

User Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy, the easiest way
to install scikit-learn is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U ml-research

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions
<https://mlresearch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_.

Installing from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands should allow you to setup the development version of the
project with minimal effort:

::

    # Clone the project.
    git clone https://github.com/joaopfonseca/research.git
    cd research

    # Create and activate an environment 
    make environment 
    conda activate research # Adapt this line accordingly if you're not running conda

    # Install project requirements and the research package
    make requirements
