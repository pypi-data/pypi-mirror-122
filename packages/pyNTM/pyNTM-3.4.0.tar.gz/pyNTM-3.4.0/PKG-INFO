This is a network traffic modeler written in python 3. The main use cases involve understanding how your layer 3 traffic will transit a given topology.  You can modify the topology (add/remove layer 3 Nodes, Circuits, Shared Risk Link Groups), fail elements in the topology, or add new traffic Demands to the topology. pyNTM is a simulation engine that will converge the modeled topology to give you insight as to how traffic will transit a given topology, either steady state or with failures. This library allows users to define a layer 3 network topology, define a traffic matrix, and then run a simulation to determine how the traffic will traverse the topology, traverse a modified topology, and fail over. If you've used Cariden MATE or WANDL, this code solves for some of the same basic use cases those do.  This package is in no way related to those, or any, commercial products.  IGP and RSVP routing is supported.
