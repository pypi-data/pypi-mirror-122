    # A number of scalings f that map the magnitude [0, infty] to [0, 1] are possible.
    # One desirable property is
    # (1)  f(1/r) = 1 - f(r).
    # This makes sure that the representation of the inverse of a function is exactly as
    # light as the original function is dark. The function g_a(r) = 1 - a^r (with some
    # 0 < a < 1), as it is sometimes suggested (e.g., on Wikipedia
    # <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring>) does _not_ fulfill (1).
    #
    # Here, we are using the simple
    #
    #   h(r) = r^a / (r^a + 1)
    #
    # with a configurable parameter a.
    #  * For a=1.21268891, this function is very close to the popular alternative
    #    2/pi * arctan(r) (which also fulfills the above property)
    #  * For a=1.21428616 is is close to g_{1/2} (between 0 and 1).
    #  * For a=1.49486991 it is close to x/2 (between 0 and 1).
    #
    # Disadvantage of this choice:
    #
    #  h'(r) = (a * r^{a-1} * (r^a + 1) - r^a * a * r^{a-1}) / (r^a + 1) ** 2
    #        = a * r^{a-1} / (r^a + 1) ** 2
    #
    # so h'(r)=0 at r=0 for all a > 1. This means that h(r) has an inflection point in
    # (0, 1) for all a > 1. For 0 < alpha < 1, the derivative at 0 is infty.
    # The arctan version does _not_ have such properties.
    #
    # Another choice that fulfills (1) is
    #
    #           / r / 2          for 0 <= x <= 1,
    #   f(r) = |
    #           \ 1 - 1 / (2r)   for x > 1,
    #
    # but its second derivative is discontinuous at 1, and one does actually notice this
    #
    #            / 1/2         for 0 <= x <= 1,
    #   f'(r) = |
    #            \ 1/2 / r^2   for x > 1,
    #
    #             / 0             for 0 <= x <= 1,
    #   f''(r) = |
    #             \ -1 / r^3   for x > 1,
    #
